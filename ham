Popping blank hostnames
I made the functions for the requester and resolver threads and the locks should be in their proper places but every time I run the program the resolver threads keep popping empty strings from the queue even though the queue is not empty Sometimes they actually pop host names that the requester put in the queue but most of the time blanks are popped from the queue Any ideas what could be causing this
same ipaddress printing multiple times for single domain name
Hey Bryan
I am getting same ipaddress multiple times for single domain name is this ok
Second thread sometimes not completing
Hey Bryan Or anyone Not sure if you're going to answer this over break but I am having an issue where if I just create two threads a requester thread and a resolver thread The requester adds hostnames to the queue and the resolver pops them off of the queue resolves the hostname and then puts the output to the output file In main I have
In my thread functions I also have a mutex queue_lock and a mutex outfile_lock
So the issue is that the second thread sometimes will go into the function and other times it will not go into the function I am not sure what I am doing wrong and was wondering if anyone ran into this also By the way the locks do not matter the program behaves the same with or without them
Hi All
Since you have not much time to work on Project 2 there would be no HW10 You had total of nine homework assignments this semester

Hanging
When I run the multi-lookup input/names1.txt input/names2.txt input/names3.txt input/names4.txt input/names5.txt output.txt command in gdb my program runs fine and exits normally However when I run that some command without gdb it just hangs and sits there I am confused as to why it works in gdb but not without gdb
